                    Hello, I'm Rudolf and a German speaking Frontend Developer currently living close to Vienna in
                    Austria.
                    On November 2019 I discovered my passion for IT and espesially for programming. Now I'm able to
                    create new business and game applications and looking forward to put my skill into practice.
